# Project Description
# First Project: User Credential and Product Management System
Expanding ASP.NET Core with ALFA (Abbreviated Language For Authorization) policies integrated with C# to manage user credentials, access control, product uploads, and product orders.

Objectives 
1. User Authentication: Designed a method to read and authenticate user credentials from a “JSON database”.

2. Data Security and Access Control: Established ALFA-based access policies to enforce data security, with different authorization levels according to user roles and attributes.
   
3. Data Import: Implemented CSV import functionality to add user data from a CSV file and prevent duplicate records.

4. User Management: Created functionality to manage bulk creation of user accounts, allowing smooth login and credential management.
