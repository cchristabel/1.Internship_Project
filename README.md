# Project Description
# First Project: User Credential and Product Management System
Expanding ASP.NET Core with ALFA (Abbreviated Language For Authorization) policies integrated with C# to manage user credentials, access control, product uploads, and product orders.

## Objectives 
1. User Authentication: Designed a method to read and authenticate user credentials from a “JSON database”.

2. Data Security and Access Control: Established ALFA-based access policies to enforce data security, with different authorization levels according to user roles and attributes.
   
3. Data Import: Implemented CSV import functionality to add user data from a CSV file and prevent duplicate records.

4. User Management: Created functionality to manage bulk creation of user accounts, allowing smooth login and credential management.

### Results and Conclusion 
The project successfully met its goals: We created a simple, working credential management system that allowed bulk user account creation, login, access controls, and error handling. 
This experience taught me foundational skills in C# and ASP.NET Core, as well as the value of using agile methodologies to approach new programming challenges in a structured, iterative way.

# Second Project: ESRS Taxonomy Data Analysis and Visualisation
The second project involved analysing and visualizing data from a European 
Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS) Taxonomy report which is related to 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), using Power Query and Power BI.

## Key Activities 
1. Data Acquisition: Connected to the Compass API to retrieve ESRS taxonomy data, using Power Query for extraction and formatting.

2. Data Transformation and Modelling: Performed data cleaning, and preparation to remove inconsistencies and ensure reliability for analysis.
 
3. Hierarchy Development: Established a clear hierarchy of sustainability concepts in ESRS taxonomy, aiding user navigation.

4. Visualisation: Designed interactive Power BI dashboards with filters and slicers, allowing customizable data exploration.

5. Iterative Testing and Feedback: Gathered stakeholder feedback to refine dashboard usability and tested visualisations for data accuracy.

### Outcomes and Conclusion 
The project produced a Power BI dashboard that visualizes sustainability data in accordance with the ESRS taxonomy, providing stakeholders with a user-friendly way to explore sustainability performance metrics.
